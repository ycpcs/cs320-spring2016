title: "Assignment 5: Use Cases"

**Due**: Monday, February 9th by 11:59 PM

This is a **team** assignment

# Your Task

Your task is to write use cases which document the requirements for the system your team will implement.

## Use cases

A use case describes a scenario in which one or more actors (agents external to the system) use the system to accomplish a goal. One of the actors involved in the use case must be an initiator of the use case.

Each use case should have a name. The name should indicate which actor is the initiator of the use case, and what goal is accomplished. For example, in the TicTacToe system, we might have a use case called "Player takes a turn."

The use case should list a sequence of steps which accomplish the goal. If there are important options that might be encountered, such as error conditions, these can be listed in "nested" steps.

So, our "Player takes a turn" use case for TicTacToe might look like this:

> **Player takes a turn**
>
> **Actor**: a human player
>
> **0.** Precondition: it is the player's turn
>
> **1.** The player chooses a location on the board in which to place a piece
>
> **2.** System checks to see if the player has won the game, or if a draw has resulted
>
> Extensions:
>
> > **1a.** If the location is already occupied by a piece, display error message and go back to step 1
>
> > **2a.** If a player has won, indicate which player
> >
> > **2b.** If a draw has occurred, inform players

Note that TicTacToe is a pretty simple example: for a more complex problem, a use case might be be more involved.

You should write *as many use cases as necessary* to document the important behaviors of your system, as experienced by the relevant actors.
